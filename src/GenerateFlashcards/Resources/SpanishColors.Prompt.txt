Generate list of words related to colors in Spanish, that can serve as a content for a short vocabulary course.

The vocabulary should range from frequently used to moderately used. I.e, i certainly want to get equivalents of words like "blue" and "yellow" (frequently used), but also "crimson" or "turquoise", but skip the niche jargon used in Graphics Editing like "Tyrian purple".

Also, I want other words related to describing colors included, like "bright", "dark", "saturated", "unsaturated", "hue" - provide as many as you can, as long as they are likely to be understood by a native speaker.

Strive to generate list of 300 words.

Output format:
```txt
# Note: Lines starting with `#` are a comment and can contain any text in natural language
# Basic colors
rojo # red
azul # blue
# ...

# Less Common Colors
turquesa # turquoise
# ...
```

I have now combined your list with a list generated by another Generative AI model. Please try to clean up and refine the list by:

1) Combine duplicate entries. If their comments differ, try to choose the best translation.
2) Remove the abbreviations like RGB and rarely used jargon, if found

The combined list is attached.
